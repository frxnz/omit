## Every single god damn thing.

Pick up the most trivial thing on your desk. Look at it. Do you see it? You're
probably thinking something along the lines of "this is a free bank pen this is
just what pens look like". Now work your backwards, from your desk to wherever a
free bank pen starts. You probably got it from your bank, or borrowed it from a
coworker and never gave it back. Before that the bank probably went through an
office supply catalog, found the cheapest pen, and ordered 1,000,000 of them
with their logo (marketing!).

But generic terrible pens don't just exist in nature. At some point, that pen
had to be manufactured. Before they could dump the plastic in a mold, they had
to make the mold. Which means they probably needed a 3D model to feed into a CNC
machine, which means&mdash;someone had to design that pen.

"But, surely, this pen was not designed by a *designer*". You may be right.
Some engineer probably dicked around in AutoCAD until he had something that
resembled a pen. And hey do you think maybe that's why it's such a shitty pen?

## What's your favorite pen?

A nice pen has a lot of characteristics that differentiate it from the pen you
stole from your cowor...got free from the bank. It probably has a nice balanced
weight to it. It probably doesn't require as much pressure to get a good ink
flow. It probably even looks kind of nice.

Every single on of those characteristics is a
design consideration. Designers don't just make things look pretty. Every facet
of this pen, from it's conception to the moment it goes into production, is a
deliberate design decision. The balance, the ink flow, the way it sounds when
click the little clicky thing. These are design decisions. These are why this
pen is your favorite pen.

## Everything.

A web designer is, fundamentally, not that different from an industrial
designer. Ultimately the task is to conceptualize some *thing* that accomplishes
a set of goals. The biggest difference is that the Vice President of Pens is
never going to walk up to a CNC operator and suggest that he just make a pen
with no plans, with no design.

"This doesn't really need to be designed, does it?"
